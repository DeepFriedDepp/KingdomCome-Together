.SYNOPSIS
    WO-102: synthetic test for the host-authority toggle set and, as the
    phases land, the MP-AUTHORITY instrumentation, the host-authority
    emitter/receiver gates and the NPC resync. No game, relay or agent needed.
.DESCRIPTION
    Same driver as Test-NpcSmoothSynthetic.ps1 (the real kdcmp.lua under
    MoonSharp, engine stubbed, fake clock); scenario file
    Test-WO102Synthetic.lua. See that file's header for the scenario list and
    for what this deliberately does NOT prove.
.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Test-WO102Synthetic.ps1
