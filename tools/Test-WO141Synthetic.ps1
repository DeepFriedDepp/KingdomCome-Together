.SYNOPSIS
    WO-141: synthetic test for the Lua half of activities and animal attacks:
    the switches, the player's one-shots at an object (the trough's wash), the
    avatar's nameplate key, the status line. No game, relay or agent needed.
.DESCRIPTION
    Same driver as Test-NpcSmoothSynthetic.ps1 (the real kdcmp.lua under
    MoonSharp, engine stubbed, fake clock); scenario file
    Test-WO141Synthetic.lua. Live evidence: docs/WO-141-findings.md.
.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Test-WO141Synthetic.ps1
